# EvolutioanryMachineLearning
This repository contains a classifiication problem which is solved with multiple evolutionary machine learning strategies, like GA, ES, PSO, LCS, etc.

And the final projects contains an integration of GA and PSO, which introduces the crossover and mutation operator to the PSO algorithm to make it explore
much more area and to decrease the speed of convergence and chance of stuck in local optima.
